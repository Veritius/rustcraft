# Official Packages
This directory contains some official packages for the game. Feel free to use them as a template for your own packages.

# Directories and Files
## package.toml
The `package.toml` file is always at the root of the package.
It describes information about the package, such as names.

Mandatory fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier for this package
- `name`: A localised package name (Fluent ID)
- `desc`: A localised package description (Fluent ID)
- `authors`: A list of authors (strings)
- `packageversion`: The version of the package (SemVer compliant)
- `gameversionrange`: Restricts the package to running within a specific range of game versions

Optional fields:
- `libentrypoint`: Entry points for shared, server, and client packages.
- `dependencies`: A list of packages that this package depends on.
- `incompatibilities`: A list of packages that this package will refuse to function with.

`package.toml` example
```toml
id = "jimmysmod.decorations"
name = "jimmysmod-decorations-package-name"
desc = "jimmysmod-decorations-package-desc"
authors = ["Jimmy"]
version = "1.7.2"
gameversionreq = "1.7.*"
libentrypoint = { shared = "jimmysmod_shared", server = "jimmysmod_client", client = "jimmysmod_server" }
dependencies = ["jimmysmod.core"]
incompatibilities = ["davesmod.decorations"]
```

## lib
The `lib` directory contains libraries that the game will load in at runtime.
- Libraries in the `shared` directory will be loaded on both the server and client.
- Libraries in the `server` directory will be loaded on only the server.
- Libraries in the `client` directory will be loaded on only the client.

**Safety is not ensured.** Modders should ensure their own code is memory and thread safe, as the game cannot check at runtime.

## assets
The `assets` directory stores any assets that the game will load.

Assets are accessed by giving a path such as `textures/cabbage.png`. The program will then find the highest priority package that has this asset, and use that. If the path is not found in any package, an error will be given.

## locale
The `locale` directory stores [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) translations, under the `.ftl` extension. The game automatically reads all files and places it in an easily accessible Bevy resource.

It's recommended to prefix your localisation string keys with the name of your package, like this: `rustcraft-core-debug-hello`. This prevents overlap with other localisation strings from other packages, as they are all collated during runtime.
